# Tommatron

This is the main directory of my Django application named "django-app". It contains all the essential configuration and settings files required to run the application.

## Key Files and Directories

- **manage.py**: This is a command-line utility that lets you interact with the Django project in various ways. It's automatically generated in each Django project.

- **settings.py**: This file contains all the configuration of your Django installation. Itâ€™s a good place to look if you need to understand how a Django project is configured.

- **urls.py**: This file is used to define the URL routes for your application. Each route is associated with a specific view function.

- **wsgi.py**: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.

- **app/**: This directory contains the actual application code. It includes modules like `admin.py`, `models.py`, `views.py`, and `tests.py`. These files handle the administration page, models, views, and tests of the application respectively.

- **migrations/**: This directory contains database migration files. Django uses these files to create and modify the database schema.

- **data/**: This directory is likely used to store any data files or resources related to the application.
